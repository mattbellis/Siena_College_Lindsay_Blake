\begin{abstract}
Fitting data to some model is a standard part of most physics analysis 
and usually involves a $\chi^2$ technique or maximum likelihood method. 
In both these cases, an analytic solution for the model is usually 
readily available and so a best-fit line or probability density function (PDF)
can be calculated. However, sometimes an analytic solution is not available,
but instead datasets based on the model can be generated and used
as templates for fitting, usually as binned histograms. This approach
becomes more challenging for multidimensional datasets. We present a
different approaching using the density of nearest neighbors as a 
replacement for a standard PDF, but still using the standard minimization
machinery, MINUIT. We find...
